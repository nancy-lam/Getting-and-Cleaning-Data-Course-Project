A- Download source data https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it to R

B- Reading files

   - Reading trainings tables
   - Reading testing tables
   - Reading feature vector
   - Reading activity labels
   - Assigning column names

C- Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following

2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
